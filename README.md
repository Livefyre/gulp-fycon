# Fycon Font Generator

We want consolidated codepoint support as well as a build system for Fycons straight from Sketch.app  

## Requirements
* Sketchtool (CLI for Sketch) http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/tool/

## Usage
```
$ npm install  
$ gulp fycons
```

This will export all files into a ``dist/`` folder.
